<p>I'm from a very small town called <a href="https://www.google.com/search?&amp;q=bethesda+gwynedd">Bethesda</a>
in North Wales, UK, where
there are lots of Welsh speakers and beautiful landscapes.</p>

<h3>FAQ</h3>
<p><small>Bethesda, my hometown, is 80%+ Welsh speaking*
and we do a
pretty
good job of living in Welsh, as is the current political motto of <a href="http://cymdeithas.cymru/maniffestobyw" target="_blank">Welsh
language activists</a>.
On the whole, we speak Welsh at home, our schools are Welsh-medium and
thanks to these high-numbers, people in local jobs end up spending a
lot of their worktime in Welsh too. Having said that, our lives are
pretty bilingual Welsh / WEnglish (isn' it).&nbsp;</small></p>
<p><small>Personally, I speak Welsh
at home with everyone but two family members. That should just
about cover the usual questions.<br />
</small></p>
<p><small>*<small>according to the 2011 census, as
far as I can
tell.</small></small></p>

I have most recently worked as a lecturer at the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/University+of+Huddersfield/@53.6431203,-1.7792803,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x487bdc7316c83381:0x622f032b6c8b151f!8m2!3d53.6431171!4d-1.7770916">University of Huddersfield</a>.
My work to date has focused on Welsh impersonals. My thesis
provides a detailed description of the Welsh impersonal construction and restrictions to
it, in order to identify the aspects of the Welsh impersonal morphology
that impact syntax. It also addresses the subject of unaccusativity in Welsh. See <a href="Output.htm">Output</a>
for more information on my thesis and <a href="projects">Projects</a>
for other projects I've been involved in.

background in linguistics (<a href="projects.htm">Projects</a>,

with a summary of my research written in Welsh (<a href="Cymraeg.htm">Cymraeg</a>),
in case
you were wondering. Ideally I'd like to share all my data, but for now,
the page <a href="mydata.htm">data</a> contains a
few lists that might be of use to people researching Welsh. </p>
